<h2>Measuring biological diversity</h2>
<p>The focus so far has been on analysing your data with a statistical
test or plotting your data to look at relationships, differences or
patterns. But in biology and ecology, we often ask questions related to
the distribution and contribution of different species to a community.
We have seen with the ordination methods that we can reduced the
dimensionality of our species data into (relatively) easily
interpretable figures where we can see whether sites are grouped
together or that species close in ordination space are likely to
co-occur. However, there times when it will be important to calculate a
<strong>diversity index</strong> for a sample or habitat.</p>
<p>Ecological communities are complex. It is important to examine the
diversity of communities for different reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>monitoring</li>
<li>ecological studies</li>
<li>conservation</li>
<li>exploitation</li>
</ul>
<p>This means that we can start to ask questions related to what is
driving the diversity of communities like:</p>
<ul>
<li>what is the long-term impact of nutrient loading on the diversity of
macroalgae in an estuary?</li>
<li>what is the relationship between habitat heterogeneity and benthic
diversity on the Antarctic Peninsula?</li>
<li>does MPA designation increase diversity and ecosystem health
compared to unprotected areas?</li>
<li>what is the impact of a fisheries on pelagic diversity?</li>
</ul>
<p>We calculate diversity indices in order to understand ecosystem
health or monitor complex communities over time and space. If our
diversity indices change in time and/ or space it will mean that the
number of species and the relative abundance of these species are
changing.</p>
<div id="section-what-is-species-diversity" class="section level3">
<h3>What is species diversity?</h3>
<p>Species diversity is an expression of community structure. Species
diversity is split into two components: <strong>species
richness</strong> and <strong>species evenness</strong>. Species
richness is the total number of species in a quantified area or sample.
Species evenness is the relative abundance of individuals within a
community or sample.</p>
<p>We can show what we mean by species richness and species evenness in
the figure of two fish communities below. There are five species of fish
in each community but there are differences in evenness. Which one is
more diverse?</p>
<p><img src="images/species_diversity1.png" /></p>
<p>The answer is the community on the right. This is because, although
there is the same species rich, each species in the community has a more
even contribution to the abundance than the community on the left which
is dominated by a single species.</p>
<p>We can see from this example that we need to consider both species
richness and species evenness when we look at species diversity. We can
combine species richness and evenness into a diversity indices which is
a mathematical index for providing information on community composition.
There are a series of different diversity indices out there that take
these two components into account when you calculate them, which we will
cover.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="section-species-richness" class="section level2">
<h2>Species richness</h2>
<p>Species richness is the most basic form of diversity indices. It is a
measure of the number of species (or other taxonomic level when you
cannot identify to species) present at site or within a sample. Where
you have a site with more species present you will have higher species
richness than a site with fewer species present. Species richness tends
to increase with the area and sampling effort so we need to be careful
when we are comparing species richness between locations, habitats or
samples because this effort will influence the number of species we
find. This is because the longer we search for a species or the more
samples we take from an area the more likely we are to encounter more
species.</p>
<p>We can calculate species richness is a number of ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>total the number of species present in a sample,</li>
<li>use an index of species richness which takes into consideration
sample size.</li>
</ul>
<p>A useful species richness which takes into consideration sample size
is <strong>Margalef’s index</strong>. Margalef’s index is based on the
number of species present in given sample. More specifically Margalef’s
index takes into consideration that species richness increases with the
total abundance.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[S_{MG} = \frac{(S-1)}{lnN}\]</span></p>
<p>where S<sub>MG</sub> is Margalef’s index, <em>S</em> is the number of
species, <em>N</em> the total abundance and <em>ln</em> is the natural
logarithm.</p>
<div id="section-calculating-species-richness-in-r"
class="section level3">
<h3>Calculating species richness in R</h3>
<p>Unfortunately, not all the packages available in R have a full suite
of functions that calculate diversity indices. It may be that you have
to pick and choose which packages you want to use depending on the
diversity indices that you want to calculate.</p>
<p>The <code>vegan</code> package has the function
<code>specnumber</code> which finds the number of species in a data set.
We will use the <code>dune</code> data set as an example.</p>
<div class="tutorial-exercise" data-label="sr1" data-completion="1"
data-diagnostics="1" data-startover="1" data-lines="0">
<pre class="text"><code># load the dune data set
data(dune)

# calculate the number of species for each site
specnumber(dune)</code></pre>
<script type="application/json" data-ui-opts="1">{"engine":"r","has_checker":false,"caption":"<span data-i18n=\"text.enginecap\" data-i18n-opts=\"{&quot;engine&quot;:&quot;R&quot;}\">R Code<\/span>"}</script>
</div>
<p>We can see for site 1 there are 5 species present while the maximum
number of species is 14 which is found at site 5. This would mean that
site 5 has the greatest species richness in this data set.</p>
<p>We can use the <code>abdiv</code> package to calculate Margalef’s
index of species richness using the <code>margalef()</code> function. We
have to manipulate the dune data set first so that the sites are in
columns and the rows are species. I have edited the dune data set so
that it is easier to use for this example and have called it
<code>dune2</code>.</p>
<div class="tutorial-exercise" data-label="sr2" data-completion="1"
data-diagnostics="1" data-startover="1" data-lines="0">
<pre class="text"><code># see how these data are structured
head(dune2)

# more efficient to get the data into a format to calculate Margalef&#39;s index for all sites
dune2_long &lt;- pivot_longer(
  data = dune2,
  cols = site_01:site_20,
  names_to = &quot;Sites&quot;,
  values_to = &quot;Count&quot;
)

# calculate Margalef&#39;s index of species richness
# use group_by() function to group the data set by sites
# use summarise() function to calculate the Margalef&#39;s Index for the whole data set
# in the brackets name the new column &quot;margalef_index&quot; then use the margalef() 
# function from the abdiv to calculate Margalef&#39;s Index based on the data in 
# the Count column
marg_div &lt;- group_by(dune2_long, Sites) %&gt;% summarise(margalef_index = margalef(Count)) %&gt;% arrange(., !desc(Sites))

# bind the Margalef&#39;s index to the environmental data and plot

marg_div2 &lt;- cbind(dune.env,marg_div)

# look at differences between management types
gf_boxplot(margalef_index ~ Management, ylab = &quot;Margalef&#39;s index&quot;, data = marg_div2) %&gt;%
  gf_theme(theme_classic())

# look at the relationship between thickness of soil A1 horizon and Margalef&#39;s index
gf_point(margalef_index ~ A1, ylab = &quot;Margalef&#39;s index&quot;, data = marg_div2) %&gt;%

</div>
<p>We can now undertake a statistical analysis to see whether there are
significant differences in Margalef’s index among the different
management types. This can be done using a linear model with continuous
or categorical variables.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="section-species-diversity" class="section level2">
<h2>Species diversity</h2>
<p>Species diversity consists of two components: species richness and
species evenness. Species evenness relates to the fact that within a
community some species can be rare, common or dominant. When we
calculate a species diversity index, we need to take into consideration
the relative proportion of each species as well as the number of species
present.</p>
<p>There are a lot of indices which you can use to calculate species
diversity and there is still contention within the scientific community
about which is the best to use. This is to do with the way species
diversity indices deal with rare or dominant species. We will look at
the 3 most commonly used indices that calculate species diversity in
slightly different ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Shannon-Wiener Index (H’)</li>
<li>Simpson’s Index (<span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span>)</li>
<li>Berger-Parker Index</li>
</ul>
<div id="section-shannon-wiener-index" class="section level3">
<h3>Shannon-Wiener Index</h3>
<p>Shannon-Wiener index (H’) is the most commonly used species diversity
index. H’ represents the uncertainty associated with predicting the
identity of a new species given the number of species and evenness of
individuals within each species. We can think about this in the context
of if we have a community with a single species then we can predict
which species we will sample so our uncertainty will be 0. As the number
of species in the community increases, we are less likely to predict
which species we will sample which means our uncertainty will increase.
H’ ranges from 0 to 5 but usually falls between 1.5 and 3.5 with higher
numbers indicating greater diversity.</p>
<p>H’ has <strong>three elements</strong> which need to be considered
when interpreting the index. These include: species richness (number of
species in the sample), H’ and evenness or equitability (J’ or E).</p>
<p>H’ can be calculated using the following formula:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[H&#39; = -\sum p_i *lnp_i\]</span></p>
<p>where <em>pi</em> is the proportional abundance ( <em>p</em> ) for
<em>i</em> th species and <em>ln</em> is the natural logarithm.</p>
<p>J’ (or E) is calculated using the following formula:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[J&#39; = H&#39;/lnS\]</span></p>
<p>where <em>S</em> is the number of species.</p>
<p>J’ has a value between 0 and 1. The logic with this index of evenness
is that if you remove species richness by dividing <em>H’</em> by
<em>lnS</em> you will be left with species evenness. The closer
<em>J’</em> is to 1 the more equally abundance each species.</p>
<p>H’ increases with species richness and evenness but it puts more
weight on species richness when calculating H’ value. The result is that
H’ can increase when there are more species <strong>OR</strong> where
the relative abundance of the different species is more even. This is
why it is important to present H’, J’ and S together to help with the
interpretation.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-simpsons-index-lambda" class="section level3">
<h3>Simpson’s Index (<span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span>)</h3>
<p>Simpson’s index (<span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span>)
considers both species richness and evenness <strong>but</strong> is
weighted towards the <strong>commonest</strong> or <strong>most dominant
species</strong>. It is often referred to as a dominance index and
differs to H’ which is more influenced by species richness. <span
class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> considers the probability that
two individuals picked at random from an infinitely large community will
belong to the same species. Because it is more likely that the dominant
species will be sampled, this index is weighted towards the most
abundant species.</p>
<p>We can calculate <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> by:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[lambda = 1 -\sum {p_i}^2 \]</span></p>
<p>where <em>pi</em> is the proportional abundance ( <em>p</em> ) for
<em>i</em> th species. The closer to 1 the greater the diversity.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-berger-parker-index" class="section level3">
<h3>Berger-Parker Index</h3>
<p>Berger-Parker index (d) is a very simple index of dominance. It
expresses the proportional abundance of the commonest species.</p>
<p>It can be calculated by:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[d = \frac{Nmax}{N} \]</span></p>
<p>where <em>Nmax</em> is the number of individuals in the most
abundance species and <em>N</em> is the total number of individuals in a
sample. It is often expressed as its reciprocal <em>1/d</em>. This means
that as the value for <em>1/d</em> increases there is a decrease in
dominance and therefore an increase in evenness.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-calculating-species-diversity-in-r"
class="section level3">
<h3>Calculating species diversity in R</h3>
<p>There is no one package that is the best to choose for calculating
species diversity when it comes doing it in R. We have used the
<code>vegan</code> package a lot and this has a function
<code>diversity()</code> which will calculate H` and <span
class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span>. However, if you want J’, then
you will have to calculate this yourself.</p>

</div>
<p>It is possible to construct a hypothesis that we want to test based
on these species diversity indices. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Null hypothesis: there is no statistical difference in Shannon
diversity among the management types.</li>
<li>Alternate hypothesis: there is no statistical difference in Shannon
diversity among the management types.</li>
</ul>
<p>We can now undertake a statistical analysis to test these hypotheses
using a linear model with continuous or categorical variables. The
response variable will be your diversity index and your explanatory
variables will be your environmental variables or sites if they can be
grouped together.</p>
</div>

<div id="section-summary" class="section level2">
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Diversity indices are important measures of community composition.
They are good for understanding whether communities are different or
similar but they need to be used with caution. It is best to combine the
use of diversity indices with multivariate analyses to have a deeper
interpretation of what is happening with the community you are
investigating.
